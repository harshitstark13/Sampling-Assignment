# Sampling-Assignment
 Sampling is a statistical technique used to select a subset of data points from a larger dataset, aiming to represent the overall characteristics of the entire population.

**Various sampling techniques on a credit card fraud dataset:**

**Random Over-sampling:**
Involves duplicating instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.

**Simple Random Sampling:**
Randomly selects a subset of data points from the entire dataset without any specific order or pattern.

**Systematic Sampling:**
Selects every nth element from the dataset after randomly choosing a starting point, creating a systematic sample.

**Cluster Sampling:**
Divides the dataset into clusters, randomly selects clusters, and includes all elements within those clusters in the sample.

**Stratified Sampling:**
Divides the dataset into strata based on certain characteristics, then randomly samples from each stratum proportionally.

**Bootstrap Sampling:**
Involves repeatedly sampling with replacement from the dataset to create multiple bootstrap samples, used for estimating statistical properties and uncertainties.
